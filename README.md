# Sentiment-Driven Algorithmic Paper Trader 📈🤖

An intelligent, full-stack paper trading platform that executes trades based on real-time and historical market sentiment analysis. The system aggregates sentiment signals (using NLP on news and social media) to algorithmically buy and sell assets, offering users a comprehensive dashboard to monitor portfolio health, track AI decision logic, run backtests, and manually intervene when necessary.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose installed.
* Alternatively, Node.js (v18+) and Python (3.10+) if running outside of Docker.

### Running with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get the entire stack (Frontend + Backend) running locally is using Docker Compose.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-paper-trader.git
   cd sentiment-paper-trader
   ```

2. **Start the containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   * **Frontend Dashboard:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   * **Backend API / Swagger Docs:** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

### Running Manually

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# Windows: venv\Scripts\activate | Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# The UI will be available at http://localhost:3000
```
